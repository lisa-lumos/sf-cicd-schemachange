Followed steps in tutorial [DevOps: Database Change Management with schemachange and GitHub](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/devops_dcm_schemachange_github/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0).

Automated release management for Snowflake by leveraging the GitHub Actions service from GitHub. 

schemachange is a lightweight Python-based tool to manage all your Snowflake objects. It follows an imperative-style approach to database change management (DCM). When schemachange is combined with a version control tool and a CI/CD tool, database changes can be approved and deployed through a pipeline using modern software delivery practices.
